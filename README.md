## How the list can be more performant if has to manage a big amount of data?

We can use a technique called "windowing", with this technique, we only render a smaller subsete of the list rows at any given time. It also can reduce the time it takes to re-render the components as well as the number of DOM nodes created.

There are some libraries that can help whit that, such as [react-window](https://react-window.now.sh/).
